Search Engine Optimization is an ever-evolving field. What worked in 2020 might not work today. Here are the top 10 trends and tips to help your website rank higher in 2024.

## 1. Zero-Click Searches
Focus on providing immediate value through schema data and Open Graph tags so your content answers questions directly on the SERP.

## 2. Page Experience and Performance
Fast loading speeds are non-negotiable. Frameworks like Astro deliver zero JavaScript by default, making them perfect for this.

## 3. High-Quality, Authentic Content
Write content that actually serves the user's intent. Ditch the fluff and focus on actionable insights.

Follow these tips to ensure your organic traffic continues to grow month over month!
