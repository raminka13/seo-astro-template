Tailwind CSS v4 revolutionizes how we style modern web applications. The latest iteration brings more logical utility classes, improved JIT performance, and zero configuration needed.

## The Power of the Engine

The new engine uses optimal configurations and CSS variables to dramatically enhance the experience. By simply using classes directly in your markup, you can rapidly prototype responsive interfaces.

### Our Recommended Approach

* Use `primary` and `secondary` color tokens to maintain a consistent theme.
* Leverage `font-title` for your headings to create a distinct brand voice.
* Apply subtle gradients for premium visual aesthetics.

With Tailwind v4, crafting visually stunning websites is an absolute breeze.
